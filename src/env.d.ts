/**
 * The globals the inline scripts hang off `window`.
 *
 * Two kinds live here. The first is the small runtime API that BaseHead and
 * BaseLayout publish so that any block can read or change an axis without
 * importing anything - a block cannot import from an inline script, and an
 * inline script cannot be imported, so a global is the only channel there is.
 *
 * The second is the handler slots. Several components attach a listener to
 * `document` inside a function that re-runs on every navigation, and the only
 * way to drop the previous registration is to have kept a reference to it.
 * Parking that reference on `window` is what makes the swap possible. They
 * are declared rather than left implicit so that a typo in one of these names
 * is a type error instead of a listener that silently accumulates - which is
 * the exact bug that reached production in ReaderSettings.
